# REPEATED STRING

The program will need to complete the given quantity  with the same string until the correct value has been reached — then, it will count the number of letters “a” in it. I made a for so it could look through the string, character from character; if the character in the current position is “a”, it’ll do an operation to update the holder by summing its value to the given number divided by the length of the string (it tells there are still letters missing to complete). The second if is for when there’s the case that it’s still not over, the operation _[n % str.length]_ is greater than its current position, which means, as before, there’s still missing letters. After that, it will add one to the holder, and repeat the whole process until there are no “a”s and all the letters have been completed and looked through.
